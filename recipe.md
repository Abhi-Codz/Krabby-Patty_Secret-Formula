__Directions for patties:__


Mix crab, egg, breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, chives, mustard, lemon juice, celery seed, onion powder, pepper and hot sauce in a large bowl. Form into 6 patties.

Heat oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the butter stops foaming. Cook the patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.

Directions for onion rings:

Place the onions, eggs, and flour into separate shallow bowls.

In another shallow bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, cayenne, oregano, basil, and red pepper.

Heat oil in a heavy skillet or deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Dip rings of onion into flour, then into the egg, and then into the bread crumb mixture, shaking off any excess after each dip.

Carefully drop each onion ring into the hot oil, and fry for about 30 seconds on each side, or until golden. Remove from hot oil to paper towels to drain.
